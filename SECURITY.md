## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### API Key Security
- ✅ **Never commit API keys** to version control
- ✅ **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- ✅ **Rotate API keys** regularly
- ✅ **Limit API key permissions** to minimum required
- ❌ **Never share API keys** in logs, screenshots, or support requests

#### Environment Security
```bash
# ✅ Good - Use environment variables
export WISPHUB_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# ❌ Bad - Hardcoded in configuration
"WISPHUB_API_KEY": "uafRB3AK.PmY8n5rhoSu3GKiY9h7XjgrdrtWbf1UM"
```

#### Network Security
- ✅ **Use HTTPS** for all API communications
- ✅ **Configure firewalls** appropriately
- ✅ **Monitor network traffic** for anomalies
- ✅ **Use VPN** for remote access when required

#### System Security
- ✅ **Keep Node.js updated** to latest LTS version
- ✅ **Update dependencies** regularly (`npm audit`)
- ✅ **Run with minimal privileges** (not as root/administrator)
- ✅ **Monitor system logs** for suspicious activity

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- ✅ **Input validation** on all user inputs (using Zod)
- ✅ **Output sanitization** for logs and responses
- ✅ **Error handling** without exposing sensitive details
- ✅ **Dependency scanning** with `npm audit`

#### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ **Validate API tokens** properly
- ✅ **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- ✅ **Log authentication attempts** appropriately
- ✅ **Use secure headers** in HTTP responses

#### Data Protection
- ✅ **Encrypt sensitive data** in transit and at rest
- ✅ **Minimize data logging** to reduce exposure
- ✅ **Implement data retention** policies
- ✅ **Secure data disposal** when no longer needed

## 🔍 Security Features

### Built-in Security

#### Input Validation
```typescript
// All inputs validated with Zod schemas
const validatedArgs = ActualizarClienteInputSchema.parse(args);
```

#### Error Handling
```typescript
// Centralized error handling without exposing internals
return ErrorHandler.handleError(error, {
  tool: 'tool_name',
  operation: 'operation_name'
});
```

#### Logging Security
```typescript
// Structured logging without sensitive data
Logger.info('Operation completed', {
  tool: 'example_tool',
  duration_ms: 1500,
  // No API keys, passwords, or PII logged
});
```

#### Rate Limiting
- **Configurable timeouts** to prevent DoS
- **Retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Connection pooling** to manage resources

### Security Headers

When deploying with a reverse proxy, consider these headers:

```nginx
# Security headers for nginx
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'" always;
```

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security-related environment variables
NODE_ENV=production              # Disable debug features
LOG_LEVEL=info                   # Reduce verbose logging
WISPHUB_TIMEOUT=30000           # Prevent hanging requests
WISPHUB_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3        # Limit retry attempts
```

### File Permissions

```bash
# Secure file permissions
chmod 600 .env                  # Config files readable by owner only
chmod 755 dist/                 # Executable files
chmod 644 *.json *.md          # Documentation readable by all
```

### Process Security

```bash
# Run as non-privileged user
sudo -u nodejs node dist/index.js

# Or with systemd
[Service]
User=nodejs
Group=nodejs
```

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging

The server logs security-relevant events:

- **Authentication attempts** (success/failure)
- **API rate limiting** triggers
- **Input validation** failures
- **Error conditions** that might indicate attacks

### Monitoring Recommendations

- **Log aggregation** (ELK stack, Splunk, etc.)
- **Alerting** on suspicious patterns
- **Regular log review** for anomalies
- **Automated scanning** with tools like:
  - `npm audit` for dependency vulnerabilities
  - `snyk` for comprehensive security scanning
  - `eslint-plugin-security` for code analysis

### Metrics to Monitor

- **Failed authentication** attempts per minute
- **Rate limiting** triggers
- **Error rates** by endpoint
- **Response times** (potential DoS indicators)
- **Memory/CPU usage** anomalies

## 🚀 Security Updates

### Update Process

1. **Monitor** security advisories for Node.js and dependencies
2. **Test** security updates in staging environment
3. **Deploy** to production with appropriate change management
4. **Verify** that security measures are working correctly

### Emergency Response

For critical security issues:

1. **Immediate**: Disable affected functionality if possible
2. **Short-term**: Apply temporary mitigations
3. **Long-term**: Implement permanent fixes
4. **Communication**: Notify users of security updates
